## Project Comments
### Project 3
- Did not follow the given "flow" of the program
- Keeps score of what the counters are (Not stateless)
- Just sends the entire JSON file and disconnects??? (No constant connection)

### Project 5
- Could not test project, did "run" but seems like client was not able to connect to server or something else.

### Project 8
- Is a FLASK project and says to use GET and POST requests with the JSON in body of request. Not following the given flow of the PDF.
  
### Project 9
- Does not have constant connection to the server, sends GET & POST requests to the server using the python package requests.

### Project 16
- Does not read from a config.json file
- Does not log actions into file

### Project 17
- Is a FLASK project and says to use GET and POST requests with the JSON in body of request. Not following the given flow of the PDF.
- Annoying: No requirements.txt file.

3. The user counter can be reset to some number not as the original.


Exploit 2
0. Project 3, Project 1, Project 9, Project 13
1. Manipulation of the counter varible connected to the client.
2. It can be exploited by putting a negative number for the INCREASE and DECREASE varible in the list of steps in the JSON configuration file.
3. The User can change their Counter in unexpected ways.
